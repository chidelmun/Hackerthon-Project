I hadn't done a session in awhile, so I decided to iterate on some of my previous ideas with growing geometry. This time I went for more of a jellyfish feel. I really enjoy the ambiance of watching jellyfish float freely in an aquarium. This was an attempt to capture a bit of that feel, and the feel of glowing undersea creatures.
