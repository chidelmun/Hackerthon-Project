This is the first "Session" in the series, and my first time really working in [regl](http://regl.party/). It's quite hard moving from a model where you think in terms of a scene graph, to one in which you think in terms of a draw call. In order to get some kind of quick output, this is one of the easier example implementations. It is a sine wave going through some plane geometry, with a secondary plane defined as the floor. All of the "lighting" for the floor is a distance from center function. It was a good exercise because it made sure that I had proper occlusion and multiple draw calls working together.
