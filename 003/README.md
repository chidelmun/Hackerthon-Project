In this exploration, I took it to space. Points in WebGL are quite fun to work with. It's very easy to create a large amount of points, and adjust how they are drawn on the screen. Up until now I had not attempted any lighting. Using a framework that handles lighting with a normal scene graph abstraction feels natural, while defining light in terms of math function is a bit more intimidating.
