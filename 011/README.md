I saw some cool work by [@hughskennedy](https://twitter.com/hughskennedy/status/820450163500060672) pass through my Twitter feed and I had to give it a whirl. This piece is my first foray into defining my geometry as quads, which has proved to be quite useful. Defining an initial cuboid shape, I went through each quad and subdivide it in one direction. One unfortunate point here, is that updating geometry buffers in WebGL is quite slow, so this one didn't scale as interestingly as others have.
