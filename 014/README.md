I have been building up my quad generation tools, and with this session I feel like I'm finally able to use them how I want to. I have a feeling in the next few sessions I will continue to refine these tools to make them easier to use and more powerful. The mask geometry is completely procedurally generated using squares that are subdivided using Catmull Clark subdivision. In general I'm using loops of geometry that I then split and move around to control the overall shape of the mask.
