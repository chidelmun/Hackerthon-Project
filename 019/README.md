Reaction diffusion systems have always been a bit mysterious to me. I found a nice [article](http://www.karlsims.com/rd.html) on the theory and implementation of reaction diffusion. This example doesn't work all the time nor in every browser. The systems are quite sensitive to variability, and I had to tweak some of the scalar values into ranges that were different than what the article provided.

Thanks to Karl Sims for [the great tutorial](http://www.karlsims.com/rd.html) on how to implement a reaction diffusion system.
