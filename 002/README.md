The second session was a jam on the first one. I love being free to copy and paste code without repercussions. There is a lot of cost in time for properly versioning and supporting shared code. This project is about output. For this first time in this project I explored a full screen background with an algorithm, using a combination of simple noise patterns. I also explored the proper use of multiple regl draw calls from the same draw function in order to draw the beams moving across the screen. The grid on the floor is pretty close to the same one in Session 001, but I made the movements into absolute changes in one direction.
