This is my second reaction diffusion implementation. I had lots of different things I played with, but ended up making the system move over time with some sine functions. I also attempted to add a sense of 3d by doing some lighting where I drove the height of the surface by the concentration of particles 'a' and 'b'.

### Credits

Thanks to Karl Sims for [the great tutorial](http://www.karlsims.com/rd.html) on how to implement a reaction diffusion system.
