Boids are classic, absolutely classic, and overdone. I love them still. This implementation built on the work of Session 005's instanced geometry, and framebuffer computed positions. Boids is a O(n^2) complexity algorithm. I didn't really do any optimizations, but threw it at the parallel nature of the graphics card. I used to work at an aquarium, and I'm still in love with the ambiance of underwater environments. I introduced some subtle post-processing effects with frambuffers by schewing the visuals with some noise in order to make it feel like you are looking at things floating around in an underwate environment. Notice on the edges how you can see where this effect falls apart as pixels are repeated.
