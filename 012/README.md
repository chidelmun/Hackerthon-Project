The name of this sessions is again one that is directly determined by the size of the space under the text. Another late night invention that I saw as funny. My quad library obtained a new power, that of extrusion. The easiest way to test that this power works, is to extrude a whole bunch of tendrils and make them flop around in the shader. This re-uses a lot of my previous visuals of underwater facsimile.
